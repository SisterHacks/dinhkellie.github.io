# Website for SisterHacks Hackathon 2018
SisterHacks is the first hackathon for the Seven Sisters schools: Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Vassar, and Wellesley Colleges. Our goal is to empower women in tech by working together with other strong women*. We want to increase interest in computer science at the Seven Sisters and connect the colleges more.

*We realize that not all students of Seven Sisters schools identify as women and we welcome all trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming students.
